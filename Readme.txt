- The given dataset has been processed and named as "processed_sgemm_product.csv"
- Two modules have been created for gradient descent algorith. 
1. LinearRegression_Threshold15.py
2. LogisticRegression_5.py

All 4 experiments related to Linear Regression can be performed using the LinearRegression module
All 4 experiments related to Logistic Regression can be run using the Logistic Regression Module. 

Python notebook "Linear Regrssion All Experiments.ipynb" contains all the experiments executed for linear Regression
Python notebook "Logistic All Experiments.ipynb" comtains all the experiments executed for logistic regression.

To start working follow below steps:
Download both the modules
Download the preprocessed data in csv file
Open both the python notebook
Change the file path in all the experiments.
